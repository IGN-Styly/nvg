This is a texture description file for player_body.png (64x64 pixels)

The texture should be a 64x64 pixel PNG file with the following layout:

LEFT SIDE (0-31px): Base player without equipment
RIGHT SIDE (32-63px): Equipment overlays

Pixel coordinates (x,y,width,height):

BASE PLAYER (Left side):
- HEAD (8,0,16,16): Light skin tone color (#E8D5B7)
- BODY (8,16,16,24): Dark gray tactical vest (#4A5568)
- LEFT_ARM (0,16,8,24): Medium gray sleeves (#6B7280)
- RIGHT_ARM (24,16,8,24): Medium gray sleeves (#6B7280)
- LEFT_LEG (8,40,8,16): Dark tactical pants (#2D3748)
- RIGHT_LEG (16,40,8,16): Dark tactical pants (#2D3748)

EQUIPMENT OVERLAYS (Right side, +32px X offset):
- HELMET (40,0,16,16): Dark green/brown helmet (#4A5D23)
- ARMOR (40,16,16,24): Tactical vest with straps (#2D4A22)
- LEFT_ARM_GEAR (32,16,8,24): Tactical sleeve gear (same as base but darker)
- RIGHT_ARM_GEAR (56,16,8,24): Tactical sleeve gear (same as base but darker)
- LEFT_LEG_GEAR (40,40,8,16): Tactical pants with knee pads (#1F2937)
- RIGHT_LEG_GEAR (48,40,8,16): Tactical pants with knee pads (#1F2937)

All parts should have 1px black outlines (#000000) for definition.
Background should be transparent.

This creates a simple pixel art player that looks tactical/military themed,
similar to Escape from Tarkov's character representation.
